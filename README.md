# HopfieldImageRecognition

For this project, I created a Hopfield Neural Network, capable of memorizing and recognizing 8 patterns, each with a size of 100 pixels. This network is written from scratch using Java. In this repository, the network is provided in Java, and the training/testing data is provided in the trainingData.txt file.

To run the network, compile the java code into an executable file. When prompted, to train the network, provide the path to the trainingData file. To test the network, also provide the path to the trainingData file. After training, the network will save the values of the weights to a .txt file. After testing, the network will save the output of which patterns were recognized.
